# Pizza Price Predictor

This project is a machine learning application that estimates the price of a pizza based on the diameter in centimeters. Using `scikit-learn` and ``Streamlit`, it offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface to view price predictions in real time.

## Features

- `Diameter input` - Allows user to insert the diameter of the pizza in centimeters.
- `Price Prediction` - Based on a linear regression model, the application estimates the price of the pizza and displays the estimated value.
- `Intuitive Interface` - Developed with `Streamlit`, the app has a simple and user-friendly interface for easy use.

## Technologies Used

- [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/) - Language used.
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - Application interface.
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Train the linear regression model.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Data manipulation.
